# rust_ls

A very basic implementation of ls in rust.

## RDD

1. Running `rust_ls` in a directory will list all files and directories in the `pwd` (excluding directories starting with `.`)
2. Running `rust_ls` with a path to another directory (e.g., `rust_ls ../`) will have the same behavior as step 1, but in the given directory
